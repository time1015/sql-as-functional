/**
 * A wrapper class for SQL connection factories.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * This class manages connections by exposing them via the handler-based
 * <code>connect</code> method. This way, connections are always isolated
 * per call to the <code>connect</code> method, and will always be closed
 * after such calls.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * This class requires a {@link ConnectionFactory} and an optional
 * default {@link ExceptionHandler}. The caller may provide an overriding
 * <code>ExceptionHandler</code> when calling the <code>connect</code> method.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * The <code>connect</code> method fetches a new {@link Connection} from
 * the provided <code>ConnectionFactory</code> and supplies it to the given
 * {@link ConnectionHandler}. This handler then gets executed and returns a
 * value, which is then returned back to the caller of the <code>connect</code>
 * method.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * In the case that (1) the <code>ConnectionFactory</code> returns a
 * <code>null</code> connection, or (2) the factory or the
 * <code>ConnectionHandler</code> threw an exception, the thrown exception
 * gets sent to the <code>ExceptionHandler</code> to consume. Afterwards,
 * a value queried from the <code>ConnectionHandler</code>'s
 * <code>defaultValue</code> will be returned to the caller.
